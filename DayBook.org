* TODO Start Vote + Countdown. Aka : distributed countdown
** Should the voters see the countdown ? Would be nice
** Careful about international times : could be a second story
** Just show the countdown in fact, no need for the possibility to vote yet. It's a distributed countdown in fact
** How long the countdown ? 10s, we'll see later
** for the animator : when I click start vote, I should see a countdown from 10s to 0s
** for the voters : when animator starts the vote, I should see a countdown from ~10s to 0s + a mention that a vote is running
** How to do that
*** animator : simple, a bit of js
*** voters
**** When the animator starts, he should send something to the server
**** the server will notify voters
**** the voters must be listening for such a message in order to display the countdown
**** the animator could display his countdown the same way as any voter (through server back and forth, this would allow the server to fix the end time)
*** from a DB point of view, we can have fields for current-vote in the Team table. This might be another case for more DDD
*** testing
**** js and UI
**** if we use selenium and a headless browser, we can e2e test the animator alone, and a voter alone by mimicking an animator start vote command
**** js unit tests

*** Another https://coderwall.com/p/kqb3xq/rails-4-how-to-partials-ajax-dead-easy for links it's just partials + the remote:true option
*** What about ajax at page load ?
*** This one uses direct jQuery, but seems a bit old (2013) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6214201/best-practices-for-loading-page-content-via-ajax-request-in-rails3
*** There is ActionCable + Redis + Devise which allows to send notifications between users https://gist.github.com/excid3/4ca7cbead79f06365424b98fa7f8ecf6
*** The rails guide on action cable is the thing http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html#dependencies

*** have a Team or TeamVote resource
*** or is Team~TeamVote ?
*** or maybe TeamVote is nested inside Team, TeamVote can be a resource, but Team is not accessible from the outside yet -> makes sense
*** or is using the team channel better ?
*** DONE check how to do nested resources
  resources :teams, only: [] do
    resource :vote, only: :create
  end

*** DONE create a Vote resource nested in Team
*** DONE call the vote :create from the StartVote button
*** DONE handling the request and sending an event to the participants
*** DONE move the code for broadcasting in the TeamChannel
*** DONE depend on httpclient in test in order to have the http constants
*** DONE try to write a test for subscription parameters : Did not manage
*** DONE can we factorize the #team-vote-state ?
**** almost 3 languages (ruby, coffee, css)
**** not sure it's possible
**** not sure the error reporting will be any better
**** DONE constant in js will give undefined !
**** DONE how do we define constants in coffee ?

** DONE Check that notifications works on heroku (domains et bla bla ...)
** TODO display a real countdown in the client
*** DONE check to find existing bootstrap countdowns on the web

* Next Stories
** TODO move backlog in github ?
*** is it possible to sync with Trello ?
* Smells
* Retrospective

*** What am I getting from docker server ?
**** + learning troubleshooting
***** Is that enough to get a job or put it on my CV ?
***** Would a 20h workshop be more efficient ?
***** Is it only for the sake of calming my learning angoisse ?
**** - Lots of headaches that I could have solved directly with heroku for example
***** Heroku does not provide docker support
***** I guess I could create my own docker config alongside heroku's to have something similar enough
***** What about the CI ?
****** There must be a standard CI for open source projects Travis, circle CI, or Codeship
*** I need to choose between learning vs doing !
*** Even learning must be targeted to a single topic
**** If planning-poker is dedicated to learning, I should focus on a single step at a time
**** No need to add learning for things I don't need
***** Docker production (ops ...) Heroku can do
***** Docker as a dev is a way to go faster, I should keep that !
***** 1st brush up my rails
***** 2nd Bootstrap, CSS
***** 3rd DDD rails
***** 4th React
*** I must start to think as an entrepreneur, and not as a developer anymore
**** programming is fun, but cannot do everything myself !
**** I should use as many (paying or free) services as possible
**** could even outsource some programming !
**** I could plan dedicated learning time and topics learning time in my schedule (ex 2h/week, 10 weeks) 20%
**** or I could just insert some 20h (~ 2 weeks) things in my priorities, for example, after every 8 weeks (2 months), for 20%
**** what's for the business vs efficient slack time
*** I should plan / timebox to 3 months at a time
**** Can build something in 3 months
**** fits a 20h learning iteration as well
